  - both sanger and ngs has problems
  - what they do:
    - directly sequence sample
    - native barcode
    - v1-v8 regions
  - chanlegges: consistency (flowcell to use, can we reuse flowcell), do they get enough biomass: minimum four barcode to use
  - intepret the data:
    - in one run, if an orgnism stands out in one sample but much less reads in other, then it is positive
    - need knowledge to do the call
    - need review board for NGS
  - nanopore: samples with contamination, with pathogen, sensitivity to need
